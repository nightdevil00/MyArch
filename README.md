# MyArch installation script
installs arch, if the script fails use dos2unix to convert the script
launch with bash ./install_arch.sh
follow the script
enjoy
the other tools are to export installed packages, install fonts etc.
recovery.sh installs my custom arch install on my drive and creates a Recovery partition which has archlinux iso downloaded weekly. so if it fails. you can always chroot without a usb stikc.
